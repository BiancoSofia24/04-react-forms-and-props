# Exercise: 2 Player Score Counter with Components

Re-create your 2 player score counter app. Create a custom component called Player that will keep track of the score for a given player.

* You should have a component called `Player`
* You should have 2 instances of the `Player` component in the app
* The `Player` component should accept a `label` prop that will allow the player name to be passed in.
